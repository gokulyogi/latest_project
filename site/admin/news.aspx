                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honda’s another hotly awaited offering is the&nbsp;Honda Civic&nbsp;sedan will soon 
                make its launch in the Indian market. Honda is planning to bring the new Civic 
                as CKD and assemble it locally at its Greater Noida facility, where it would 
                also share the assembly line of the recently launched<span>&nbsp;CR-V&#39;</span>s. The 
                new model is expected to launch in&nbsp;early 2019. The 2019 Honda Civic price is 
                expected to range between Rs 15 lakh to 20 lakh (ex-showroom).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The source also said that the new Honda will get a 68 percent of 
                localization level, which a pinch higher than the CR-V’s 65 percent 
                localization. Honda has a production capacity of 280,000 units per annum and 
                presently, it is making use of 180,000 units of its capacity and could rise by 
                50,000 units as soon as the production of the new Honda Civic begins, that would 
                make the utilization of this production capacity to around 230,000 annually.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking to carandbike, a source said, &quot;We had upgraded our Greater 
                Noida based production facility before we started the production of the 2018 
                Honda CR-V to accommodate new models. The assembly lines at both of our plants 
                (Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh and Tapukara, Rajasthan) are flexible and we can 
                produce multiple models on them.&quot;<br />
